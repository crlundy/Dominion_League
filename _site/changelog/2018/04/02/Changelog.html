    <p>Changes for Season 27:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updating group language to reflect the new size of the league and time zone-based divisions at the lower levels.</li>
  <li>Explicitly spelling out penalties and deadlines for late finishes and mid-season drops.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quote From: Old Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I. League Structure</strong></p>

  <p>Each League season lasts for 6 weeks, and is followed by a 2 week break. Players are divided into groups of at most 6 players. Groups are arranged in tiered divisions. Groups are created by seeding them based on their level on the Shuffle IT client. There is a single A group and two B groups. C, D and E divisions have a maximum of 4, 8, and 16 groups, respectively, but may have fewer groups depending on the number of players available. There is also an F division available for beginner players.</p>

  <p>At the end of the season the players with 1st place ranks promote to the next level, while players ranked 5th or 6th place demote.</p>

There is a single A division, 2 B divisions, 4 C divisions, 8 D divisions, up to 16 E divisions, and up to 32 F divisions. Divisions are determined by a seeding algorithm depending on level on the Shuffle IT client (dominion.games), with time zone taken into account in the lower divisions (D, E, and F).</p>

  <p>At the end of the season the players with 1st place ranks promote to the next level, while players ranked 5th or 6th place demote. E division demotions (to F) will possibly be more lenient depending on the number of players.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VIII. Penalities</strong></p>

  <p>Players who finish late in two consecutive seasons they play will get their overall score reduced by 1. This penalty will only count for the own total and own average score and not for the calculation of tie breakers of oneself or other players. The official deadline to meet is Monday (the day after the official deadline), 15:00 UTC, so that people from the US west coast and Alaska can finish matches easily which they started playing on Sunday night.</p>

<p><strong>Quote from: New Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VIII. Late Finish Penalties</strong></p>

  <p>The official deadline to report your match results is the day after the official deadline (a Monday) at 15:00 UTC, so that people from the western-most time zones can easily finish and report matches which they started playing on Sunday night.</p>

  <p>Players who are responsible for finishing their games late in two consecutive seasons they play will get their overall score reduced by 1. This penalty will only count for the own total and own average score and not for the calculation of any tiebreakers. Responsibility is determined by the group moderator, and any players who believe their opponents are responsible for the delay should send their moderator all relevant communications for evaluation.</p>

  <p>If late game results are not reported within a week of the deadline, the responsible players are considered to have dropped out mid-season, with more severe penalties as described in the following section.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season</strong></p>

  <p>Players dropping out during the season have a significant negative impact on their group. Unfortunately, some must drop out, or become inactive and are have to be removed by the moderators. It is difficult to deal with matches that have been played by a player who has dropped because the matches they have played and have failed to play can have significant impacts on the group standings. The following rules are used for dropped players:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer game.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played exactly 1 match, the match result is voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer game.</li>
    <li>If they’ve played more than 1 match the results will be retained in the standings unless there are other reasons to void those results (e.g. If there is evidence suggesting that the dropped player purposefully threw games prior to dropping. This very rarely happens and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The group moderator will have the final decision such a situation.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Players who become inactive and are removed by the moderating team will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons. If a player needs to drop from the league for personal reasons, they should inform their moderator as promptly as possible. If a player is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or scheduling issues) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>

  <p><strong>Players who drop mid-season will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons.</strong> If a player drops out within the first week of the season or is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or late finishes) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>
