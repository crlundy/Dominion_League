<p><strong>Changes to II. Match Structure and Policies</strong><br />
Old:<br />
<strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The League standard is to play games on Dominion Online with VP tracking enabled on randomly generated kingdoms using all cards that either player owns (the default on dominion.games, no matter who hosts the table). These standards should be followed for all games unless both players agree to alternate arrangements. Games may be played without VP tracking, in person, with only a limited set of expansions, particular kingdom cards you want practice with, etc., but both players must consent. If you wish to make arrangements that differ from the League standard, you should make this clear to your opponent when scheduling your match. Spectators must be allowed for all matches in Divisions A-D. Spectators for matches in Divisions E and F are encouraged, but if you or your opponent request to disallow spectators you must honor that request. You are encouraged but not required to allow spectators to see your cards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New: <br />
<strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The League standard is to play matches on Dominion Online, though you may play in-person. For games played online, spectators must be allowed for matches in tiers A, B, C, and D, and players cannot request to disallow spectators. Spectators are encouraged in other tiers, but a request by any player to disallow spectators must be honored. Players in all tiers are encouraged to turn the option to allow spectators to see their cards on and the option for players to see spectator chat off.</p>

  <p>For games played online, the table should have the following settings by default, any of which both players can mutually agree to change before the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The disliked cards lists and banned cards lists should be respected, and the liked cards lists should not be. Except for the foregoing, Kingdoms should be generated randomly with all cards either player owns, from zero to two landscapes, and no specific cards or landscapes required.</li>
    <li>The game should be unrated.</li>
    <li>The victory point counter should be used.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Added:<br />
<strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A playing session is a series of one or more games between the same two players. A match may be played over one or more playing sessions. During an individual session, players may not adjust their cardlists unless mutually agreed upon. For the purpose of this rule, any consecutive games played between the same two players with less than 24 hours between them are considered to be part of the same session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Changes to IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season</strong><br />
Old:<br />
<strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following rules are used for dropped players:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will seek to replace them with another player from the waiting list.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played fewer than 3 complete matches (18 games), any games they played are voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer match.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played at least 3 complete matches (18 games), the results will be retained in the standings. In addition, so as not to compare any players with different numbers of games played, any unplayed games with dropped players will be simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play. The dropped player is then considered ineligible and finishes below all other players, including possible demotion in any subsequent season in which they might return.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Players who drop mid-season will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons.</strong> If a player drops out within the first week of the season or is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or late finishes) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>
