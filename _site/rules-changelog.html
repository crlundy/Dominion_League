Old:<br />
<strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each League season lasts for 6 weeks, and is followed by a 2 week break. Players are divided into groups of at most 6 players. Groups are arranged in tiered divisions. There is a single A division, 2 B divisions, 4 C divisions, 8 D divisions, up to 16 E divisions, and up to 32 F divisions. Divisions are determined by a seeding algorithm depending on previous performance in the League, taking into account time zone in the lower tiers (D, E, and F) and Dominion Online level for new players.</p>

  <p>At the end of the season the players with 1st place ranks promote to the next level, while players ranked 5th or 6th place demote. E division demotions (to F) will possibly be more lenient depending on the number of players.</p>

  <p>Ties are broken in the following order.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Number of total points from matches between the tied players</li>

  <p>At the end of the season, players who place 1st in their groups will promote to the next higher division, and players who place 5th and 6th will demote to the next lower division. For instance, the players who place 5th and 6th in the A group will demote to the B division, and the players who place first in B1 and B2 groups will promote to the A division to take their places. We might possibly be more lenient in the lower divisions depending on overall numbers.</p>

<strong>Quote</strong></p>

  <p>To join the League, you must join the Dominion (Card Game) Discord server. To join the Dominion Discord server follow this link: https://discord.gg/jeN2sAB</p>

  <p>Once you have joined the Discord Server you may sign up to join the League here: http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?board=60.0</p>

  <p>You’re not required to own any cards in order to sign up, and who owns what will not have any influence on how players are placed into groups.
When a player joins for the first time, they are placed in a division based on the availability of spots and their level on the Dominion Online Leaderboard.
At the end of each season, players must indicate if they intend to stay in the League, or leave for the next season. You will not automatically re-enter the next season without specifying your preference. Please indicate whether you intend to return for the next season or not in your division’s scheduling thread before the end of the season.</p>

  <p>Available spots that are created when players leave the League will be filled with players in the following order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Players who left the League after a prior season within the last year (up to six seasons before the new one) are inserted at the level they previously earned.</li>
    <li>Players who are joining for the first time, or who we were unable to place based on criteria #1 will be inserted into remaining openings by their rating on the Dominion Online leaderboard.</li>
    <li>The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 2nd are promoted.</li>
    <li>The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 5th skip demotion.</li>

Once you have joined the Discord Server you may sign up to join the League by replying to the latest Signups post: http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?board=60.0. You do not need to purchase a subscription to Dominion Online, and Dominion Online subscriptions have no bearing on players’ tiers, divisions, or seeding.</p>

  <p>At the end of each season, players who want to return for the following season must fill out the Returning form linked in their division’s Discord channel, otherwise by default they will leave the League. The following priorities are used, in order, to fill the open spots created by players who leave:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Players returning to the League after playing in one of the past 6 seasons are placed into the tiers they would have most recently returned to, starting with the players that played most recently and with ties broken by seeding. For purposes of this priority only, divisions may have up to 7 players each.</li>
    <li>Players returning from before the past 6 seasons, or joining for the first time, are placed into tiers based on their Dominion Online level.</li>
    <li>Players who finished in second place with a high score in the previous season are offered a free promotion up to the next higher tier.</li>
    <li>Players who finished in fifth place with a high score in the previous season are offered a free promotion to not demote to the next lower tier.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When multiple players are offered free promotions (as described above) to a tier with not enough open spots for all of them, that tier determines how players are chosen: For tiers A, B, and C, the moderators arrange play-in matches between those players. For all other tiers, the moderators choose the players at their discretion, taking into account time zones.</p>

  <p>During a season, the moderators may, at their discretion, fill new open spots from a waiting list.</p>

  <p>The League standard is to play games on Dominion Online with VP tracking enabled on randomly generated kingdoms using all cards that either player owns (the default on dominion.games, no matter who hosts the table). These standards should be followed for all games unless both players agree to alternate arrangements. Games may be played without VP tracking, in person, with only a limited set of expansions, particular kingdom cards you want practice with, etc., but both players must consent. If you wish to make arrangements that differ from the League standard, you should make this clear to your opponent when scheduling your match. Spectators must be allowed for all matches in Divisions A-D. Spectators for matches in Divisions E and F are encouraged, but if you or your opponent request to disallow spectators you must honor that request. You are encouraged but not required to allow spectators to see your cards.</p>

    <li>The disliked cards lists and banned cards lists should be respected, and the liked cards lists should not be. Except for the foregoing, Kingdoms should be generated randomly with all cards either player owns, from zero to two landscapes, and no specific cards or landscapes required.</li>

  <p>The following rules are used for dropped players:</p>

    <li>If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will seek to replace them with another player from the waiting list.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played fewer than 3 complete matches (18 games), any games they played are voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer match.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played at least 3 complete matches (18 games), the results will be retained in the standings. In addition, so as not to compare any players with different numbers of games played, any unplayed games with dropped players will be simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play. The dropped player is then considered ineligible and finishes below all other players, including possible demotion in any subsequent season in which they might return.</li>

  <p><strong>Players who drop mid-season will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons.</strong> If a player drops out within the first week of the season or is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or late finishes) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>

  <p><strong>X. League Moderation</strong></p>

  <p>The League is moderated by a group of players whose role is to ensure the League runs smoothly. Moderators are allowed, but not required, to play in the League. Moderators are assigned divisions (never a division in the same tier they play in) to be the primary point of contact for those divisions. Their responsibilities include checking up on players who have fallen behind and removing those who are non-responsive for a considerable period of time. However, all moderators are able to assist players with any issues they face.</p>

  <p>League moderators are also responsible for adjudicating any disputed rules infractions. If a moderator decision needs to be made that affects the outcome of a game, the players should finish the game and the player who requested the decision may protest the game by contacting their moderator with a description of what occurred and the game number. The moderator team will review the game and make a ruling by a majority vote whether the game results stand or that the game must be replayed.</p>

  <p>If you ever take issue with a decision made by the moderator team, feel free to reach out to us and we will discuss it at the next moderator meeting (one meeting each season).</p>

The League recommends playing the first game with random starting players, and then alternating starting players manually. Each player is receives 1 point for each game they won, and 0.5 points for each tie for that match.</p>

  <p>The League standard is to play games on Dominion Online with VP tracking enabled on randomly generated kingdoms using all cards that either player owns (the default on dominion.games, no matter who hosts the table). These standards should be followed for all games unless both players agree to alternate arrangements. Games may be played without VP tracking, in person, with only a limited set of expansions, particular kingdom cards you want practice with, etc., but both players must consent. If you wish to make arrangements that differ from the League standard, you should make this clear to your opponent when scheduling your match.</p>

  <p>The League suggests completing all 6 games of a match on the same day, but this is not required. When scheduling, keep in mind that a matches typically take 1.5-2 hours. After completing a match one of the players should post the result (via Google forms sent to each player at the start of the season) as soon as possible.  If a match is started, but not completed, the partial result, including the number of times each player has gone first should be posted in the Partial Results thread. When the match is completed, the partial result should be removed.

          <p>Deleted Section VIII. Incomplete Games:</p>

<p><strong>Quote</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VIII. Incomplete Games</strong></p>

  <p>If a game unexpectedly ends because either Dominion Online breaks down or one of the players accidentally disconnects (internet connection lost, computer crashes, …) please use the following guidelines.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Discuss the game together with your opponent. Was the game completely open, or was either player ahead? And if there was a lead, was it small, significant or almost insurmountable?</li>
    <li>Based on the players assessment of the game, you may chose one of the following options:
      <ul>
        <li>If you decide game was even or the lead was small, simply replay the game.</li>
        <li>If you decide one player had a strong lead, report this game as 0.75-0.25 in favor of the leading player.</li>
        <li>If you decide one player had a very significant lead, then that player should be awarded a win for that game.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We know that arbitrating this process with your opponent may be scary. Determining the state of a Dominion match is not a very scientific process especially when the players that have to make these decisions are competing. An ideal result is not possible when disconnects are involved, and there is no expectation of a perfect outcome. The purpose of this process is to give clear guidelines for players to adhere to when resolving the situation. If you really feel like you were ahead, and your opponent feels the same, then you are entitled to some equity and this process attempts to provide that.</li>
    <li>Please know that in coming to an agreement may require one player to lose some equity. E.g. If you estimate there you have a 5% chance to win a game, then resigning it due to a disconnect may not feel great because you have given up a chance you had to win that game. It’s still the most fair option, because 5% is a lot closer to nothing than to 25%.  We do not allow match results more precise than 0.75/0.25 because estimating win chances in these situations is very imprecise.</li>
    <li>If you and your opponent cannot come to an agreement about the game state, you can chose to defer the decision to your group moderator. Your moderator won’t enjoy making this decision for you, so please make every possible effort to come to an agreement with your opponent. Both players should post their thoughts on the game state in their group’s thread and which result they think is best before sending a message to the group moderator. Make only one post with your opinion. There will not be any extended discussion about the game. The group moderator will make a decision based on the players statements and their own evaluation of the game. This decision could be a win/loss, replay, tie, or 0.75/0.25.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>VII. Respectfulness</strong></p>

  <p>Players are expected to treat one another with respect at all times. Examples of poor conduct include swearing at another player or otherwise harassing them, excessively complaining about luck, rage-quitting and leaving a scheduled match, or intentional slow-playing.</p>

  <p>If another player acts abusively towards you, you should contact your moderator as soon as possible. You are encouraged to provide screenshots of game chats or forum/discord messages as evidence.</p>

  <p>Depending on the severity of the offense, violating this rule may result in a warning, a ban of one or more seasons, or a permanent ban from the League.</p>

          <p>Based on something that actually happened (and affected the winner of a division!), we’ve decided to clarify the rule about when players’ remaining matches are “simulated.” Three complete matches are not directly necessary, just the corresponding number of games.</p>

<p><strong>Quote From: Old Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season</strong></p>

  <p>Players dropping out during the season have a significant negative impact on their group. Unfortunately, some must drop out, or become inactive and have to be removed by the moderators. It is difficult to deal with matches that have been played by a player who has dropped because the matches they played and failed to play can have a significant impact on the group standings. The following rules are used for dropped players:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will seek to replace them with another player from the waiting list.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played fewer than 3 complete matches, any games they played are voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer match.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played at least 3 complete matches, the results will be retained in the standings. In addition, so as not to compare any players with different numbers of games played, any unplayed games with dropped players will be simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play. The dropped player is then considered ineligible and finishes below all other players, including possible demotion in any subsequent season in which they might return.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Players who drop mid-season will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons.</strong> If a player drops out within the first week of the season or is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or late finishes) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>

    <li>If the removed player has played more than 1 match, the results will be retained in the standings unless there are other reasons to void those results (e.g. if there is evidence suggesting that the dropped player purposefully threw games prior to dropping).

          <p>volfied caught a part of the rules that was under the old “F is the new E” thinking… there is still demotion and promotion between E and F like any other pair. (We might want to consider creating a beginners G division at some point…)</p>

<p><strong>Quote From: Old Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>III. Standings</strong></p>

  <p>During the season, the standings for each group will be automatically updated as players complete matches. The players in each group will be ranked based on the average number of points they have received in each match. Ties are broken in the following order.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Number of total points from matches between the tied players</li>
    <li>The sum of the number of points received in each match multiplied by the total score of the opponent from that match.</li>
    <li>Coin Flip</li>
  </ol>

  <p>At the end of the season, players who place 1st in their groups will promote to the next higher division, and players who place 5th and 6th will demote to the next lower division. (e.g. the players who place 5th and 6th in the A group will demote to the B division, and the players who place first in B1 and B2 groups will promote to the A division to take their places.) Players in the F division, are not required to promote to the E division unless they wish to; similarly, Players in the E division will not demote to F unless they wish to. (However, the League may require a player to promote from F or remain in the E group if the player’s ability is not in line with the F division.)</p>

We might possibly be more lenient in the lower divisions depending on overall numbers.</p>

At the end of each season, players must indicate if they intend to stay in the league, or leave for the next season. You will not automatically re-enter the next season without specifying your preference. Please indicate whether you intend to return for the next season or not in your division’s scheduling thread before the end of the season.</p>

  <p>Available spots that are created when players leave the league will be filled with players in the following order:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Players who left the league after a prior season within the last year (up to six seasons before the new one) are inserted at the level they previously earned.</li>
    <li>Players who are joining for the first time, or who we were unable to place based on criteria #1 will be inserted into remaining openings by their rating on the Dominion Online leaderboard.</li>
    <li>The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 2nd are promoted.</li>
    <li>The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 5th skip demotion.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>Explicitly spelling out penalties and deadlines for late finishes and mid-season drops.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quote From: Old Rules</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I. League Structure</strong></p>

  <p>Each League season lasts for 6 weeks, and is followed by a 2 week break. Players are divided into groups of at most 6 players. Groups are arranged in tiered divisions. Groups are created by seeding them based on their level on the Shuffle IT client. There is a single A group and two B groups. C, D and E divisions have a maximum of 4, 8, and 16 groups, respectively, but may have fewer groups depending on the number of players available. There is also an F division available for beginner players.</p>

  <p>At the end of the season the players with 1st place ranks promote to the next level, while players ranked 5th or 6th place demote.</p>

  <p><strong>VIII. Penalities</strong></p>

  <p>Players who finish late in two consecutive seasons they play will get their overall score reduced by 1. This penalty will only count for the own total and own average score and not for the calculation of tie breakers of oneself or other players. The official deadline to meet is Monday (the day after the official deadline), 15:00 UTC, so that people from the US west coast and Alaska can finish matches easily which they started playing on Sunday night.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VIII. Late Finish Penalties</strong></p>

  <p>The official deadline to report your match results is the day after the official deadline (a Monday) at 15:00 UTC, so that people from the western-most time zones can easily finish and report matches which they started playing on Sunday night.</p>

  <p>Players who are responsible for finishing their games late in two consecutive seasons they play will get their overall score reduced by 1. This penalty will only count for the own total and own average score and not for the calculation of any tiebreakers. Responsibility is determined by the group moderator, and any players who believe their opponents are responsible for the delay should send their moderator all relevant communications for evaluation.</p>

  <p>If late game results are not reported within a week of the deadline, the responsible players are considered to have dropped out mid-season, with more severe penalties as described in the following section.</p>

  <p><strong>IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season</strong></p>

  <p>Players dropping out during the season have a significant negative impact on their group. Unfortunately, some must drop out, or become inactive and are have to be removed by the moderators. It is difficult to deal with matches that have been played by a player who has dropped because the matches they have played and have failed to play can have significant impacts on the group standings. The following rules are used for dropped players:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer game.</li>
    <li>If the removed player has played exactly 1 match, the match result is voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer game.</li>
    <li>If they’ve played more than 1 match the results will be retained in the standings unless there are other reasons to void those results (e.g. If there is evidence suggesting that the dropped player purposefully threw games prior to dropping. This very rarely happens and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The group moderator will have the final decision such a situation.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Players who become inactive and are removed by the moderating team will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons. If a player needs to drop from the league for personal reasons, they should inform their moderator as promptly as possible. If a player is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or scheduling issues) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team’s discretion.</p>
