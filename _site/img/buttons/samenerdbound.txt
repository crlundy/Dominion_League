snakeface: 
Wow that would have been really good next turn
truffles: 
buy some pixies and sacs?
nerdbound: 
sorry thinking
Cave-o-sapien: 
is this still the same turn
snakeface: 
Yes
snakeface: 
SamE likely to have 8+ gains
Cave-o-sapien: 
I think i've read about protests in 10 different major cities since their last play
snakeface: 
Now SamE pops earth and it's over anyways
snakeface: 
Uh not like that
Cave-o-sapien: 
what is the sacrifice for?
Fircoal: 
this wins doesn't it?
Cave-o-sapien: 
in hand?
nerdbound: 
gg
SamE: 
gg
SamE: 
should have left 4 provinces

Cave-o-sapien: 
rough turn
Cave-o-sapien: 
gain two highways, probably a trade route, then hopefully draw and buy 2 highways?
Cave-o-sapien: 
maybe that's too risky
snakeface: 
Did a wish just get held
bobbydj18: 
yea probably wants it to be prov down the line?
bobbydj18: 
no idea if that's good
Cave-o-sapien: 
i don't understand nerdbound's last turn
snakeface: 
Man spending a wish on Amb has serious doom vibes
Cave-o-sapien: 
this wins right?
snakeface: 
It's a card short?
snakeface: 
Or coin
Cave-o-sapien: 
throne paddock, play paddock,trade route a copper
Cave-o-sapien: 
oh, i'm short
Cave-o-sapien: 
no that works
Cave-o-sapien: 
I think it worked, because TR is $3
snakeface: 
Well this wasn't it at all
snakeface: 
Ah I still had it at 1
snakeface: 
Yeah worked then
Cave-o-sapien: 
i had it at 2
Cave-o-sapien: 
lol
snakeface: 
I wonder if nerdbound would have found it with one less Province in supply
Cave-o-sapien: 
it's weird because with that in mind, his turn made a lot of sense. like it felt like that's what he was angling for
snakeface: 
Darn
nerdbound: 
gg
nerdbound: 
cool gimme 5 minutes to eat something
SamE: 
stupid 2-5
snakeface: 
What the heck
snakeface: 
It's like 10 pm
snakeface: 
What kind of savage eats that late
Fircoal: 
I had dinner like just half an hour ago
snakeface: 
Apparently a Fircoal kind of savage
SamE: 
brb as well
SamE: 
ok I'm back, ready whenever you are
nerdbound: 
cool

snakeface: 
This is almost the legendary Rebuild board with Page on it
Fircoal: 
What is the legendary rebuild board?
snakeface: 
If Stonemason were PStone and Raider weren't here I think Rebuild could win
jonts: 
why play warrior ?
truffles: 
ouch
snakeface: 
No shuffle
truffles: 
why not?
jonts: 
seal
jonts: 
play 2 cgs'
truffles: 
AttACCkk
truffles: 
this is really slow lol
jonts: 
I think this is normal pace for these two
jonts: 
like this seems clear buy province to me
truffles: 
i'm not sure what the hesitation is
truffles: 
like click on hero surely
jonts: 
now play 1 copper per minute

truffles: 
cobbler looks good here
jonts: 
guildhall seems solid here
jonts: 
im tempted to just play jack/money
snakeface: 
Cobbler looks bad actually
truffles: 
yeah
snakeface: 
I agree with jonts
truffles: 
guildhall 2 strong
jonts: 
fool/jack vs silver/jack seems a little close? still want silver/jack though i think
snakeface: 
Also has the advantage of not to remember what your deck is trying to do between turns
truffles: 
i prefer fool jack
jonts: 
sam with the nut draw
truffles: 
second jack?
jonts: 
sure
snakeface: 
I think Silver better
truffles: 
ports are weird.
jonts: 
not sure about the ports over silver
snakeface: 
And definitely not ports
jonts: 
he's drawing very well though
truffles: 
relic seems meh with jack
jonts: 
seems better than the other options
truffles: 
but i guess you;'re not guaranteed to see it every turn
jonts: 
leave silver/estate
truffles: 
i could see keeping the estate
truffles: 
i guess there is worm
jonts: 
too early to not trash estate i think
snakeface: 
Ending with 6 coffers here means should have greened sooner
truffles: 
like worm pretty tempting here
truffles: 
for samE
jonts: 
if nerd provinces, i worm
jonts: 
otherwise no
truffles: 
yeah
Cave-o-sapien: 
i don't see a compelling reason to not worm
Cave-o-sapien: 
no matter what nb does
jonts: 
if nerd doesnt province you just safely province every turn and win
jonts: 
no reason to put another stop card in to maybe miss province
Cave-o-sapien: 
stop card?
truffles: 
well
truffles: 
you exile
truffles: 
it
jonts: 
oh so thats how worm works
jonts: 
good to know
jonts: 
lol the relic
jonts: 
double nullified
truffles: 
heh
jonts: 
just click province
jonts: 
why is he thinking
truffles: 
indeed
Cave-o-sapien: 
could be a trap
truffles: 
he is torturing nerd for slowplaying earlier
jonts: 
that is actually fair

snakeface: 
I wish I had a 6th ban slot for Familiar
jonts: 
i dont like the settlers
jonts: 
im questioning a lot of the decisions so far
jonts: 
trying to skip familiar here seems like madness
jonts: 
ok that works
snakeface: 
I guess they decided to make the board less miserable by uncovering BV for everyone
jonts: 
yes, this board plays a lot better when they both decide to drain settlers asap
jonts: 
not sure why they did
jonts: 
but here we are
snakeface: 
What
Fircoal: 
????
jonts: 
that seemed like clear double familiar to me
Fircoal: 
yeah
Fircoal: 
assuming you can do that
Fircoal: 
which I wans't fully sure on
snakeface: 
Or double BV
Fircoal: 
but that seems so much better
snakeface: 
Well
Fircoal: 
double bv seems so much better than bv/werewolf
nerdbound: 
gg
Fircoal: 
not that it ended up mattering
Fircoal: 
but I'd rather be cutting off the opponent's supply of actions
nerdbound: 
last one, yeah?
SamE: 
yup

gl hf :-)
Joining game #46703507 on ohio.
snakeface: 
Oh no part 2
jonts: 
this one has some play i think
snakeface: 
This time for a different reason though
jonts: 
goat sort of saves this board from being super terrible
snakeface: 
I'm imagining the Charm plays later
snakeface: 
And the time
jonts: 
banquet time
jonts: 
do you goat this ST as sam?
snakeface: 
The St topdeck for nerdbound was so bad
jonts: 
i think its ok if you goat it
jonts: 
or wait, no its not
jonts: 
nm
kaplane: 
!match
snakeface: 
1-0 SamE
jonts: 
theyve been playing for 4 hours so this is game 2
snakeface: 
At least for games I got through all of
kaplane: 
wait is this actually game 2?
kaplane: 
game 1 took two hours?
jonts: 
i think its game 6
Fircoal: 
it's game 6
kaplane: 
oh
snakeface: 
I can only really remember the Jack Guildhall one
kaplane: 
that seems like a pretty reasonable pace
snakeface: 
These things can be deceiving
jonts: 
i feel like silver is not as bad here as they are playing like it i
jonts: 
is
nerdbound: 
sorry
snakeface: 
Man Squire is so not this good
jonts: 
squire/wt does not seem like the way to draw here to me
Fircoal: 
squire seems good to me here
jonts: 
a few seem good
jonts: 
you dont need 5
snakeface: 
I want whatever drains the Charm pile
kaplane: 
squire is a village which is nice I guess
kaplane: 
and I want to play with WH I think
jonts: 
you dont need much terminal space
jonts: 
no WH for me
jonts: 
charm/st all the way
Cave-o-sapien: 
WH seems too expensive
kaplane: 
I would assume thats why we're loading up on squires
Cave-o-sapien: 
but storyteller charm is sort of awkward
kaplane: 
maybe its not tho
Fircoal: 
more terminal space with wgoat/draw cards seems nice
jonts: 
i'd rather be doing HG/gold anyway for terminal space
snakeface: 
It's just like get all the Charms, get the rest of the Storytellers, get all the Duchies
Cave-o-sapien: 
does that really draw and buy that well?
jonts: 
you need a bit more than just charm/st i think
jonts: 
but not that much
snakeface: 
Yeah a bit of Gold HG before the Duchies can be done
Joining game #46703507 on ohio.
snakeface: 
trashing an estate looks better than having a Squire
jonts: 
i would certainly be wanting to trash more aggressively
jonts: 
especially estates
jonts: 
they are super gross
jonts: 
trash estate/ topdeck charm/st seems good here
snakeface: 
All Charms all the time
jonts: 
not topdecking charm is so strange
jonts: 
he deserves this if it duds
jonts: 
and keep thinning copper
jonts: 
st still likes when you thin copper
snakeface: 
St does not like being a fancy Warehouse
jonts: 
fancy lab is so much better
jonts: 
i was kind of rooting for dud there
Cave-o-sapien: 
why does the log not show (+$2) for the Charm?
jonts: 
its just in really small font
nerdbound: 
rip
SamE: 
sad
jonts: 
nerds deck should be less likely to dud too
SamE: 
yeah whether to play the charms on storytellers or not is tricky
jonts: 
but also you have to play your treasure there
snakeface: 
Hard to say
nerdbound: 
i went back and forth on that several times while waiting for my turn
Joining game #46703507 on ohio.
snakeface: 
It has way more Squires which are a lot like Copper
jonts: 
this is true
jonts: 
theres no reason they shouldnt be reliably drawing deck by this point though
truffles: 
match still ongoing?
snakeface: 
Hey it's the last game
jonts: 
a win here seems maybe asking too much
jonts: 
but maybe not
jonts: 
charm/estates could be possible
SamE: 
brb
jonts: 
this looks winning?
truffles: 
yeah it wins
Fircoal: 
it does?
truffles: 
banquet for two charms, gain 3 estates, buy 2
jonts: 
yes
Fircoal: 
oh right banquet
snakeface: 
truffles has a major advantage for seeing wins of having not been watching
jonts: 
pls dont miss this nerbound. Let us leave this purgatory.
snakeface: 
Alternatively do miss it
snakeface: 
By somehow thinking too long
jonts: 
just play the hunt at 3 minutes 59 seconds
truffles: 
yeah no way my attention span would have survived if I was watching the whole time
snakeface: 
Hey you're not allowed to press the button in league
SamE: 
heh got the resign prompt
truffles: 
I think you should be :p
SamE: 
brb again
truffles: 
like that is the most relaxed version of the timer, barring disconnect/etc. reasons
snakeface: 
It will be so much better when the timer resigns you automatically
nerdbound: 
sorry i think i'm just short
snakeface: 
At 5 minutes difference
Fircoal: 
that sounds awful
jonts: 
automatic resign would be fine by me
SamE: 
excellent :D
SamE: 
hey the prompt went away
jonts: 
3:59 till the next click
jonts: 
and win missed
snakeface: 
Apparently not enough time
SamE: 
brb again
snakeface: 
lol
truffles: 
missing a win isn't a huge deal
jonts: 
sam has brbed about 10 times htis match
truffles: 
but like
jonts: 
dont take 10 minutes to miss a win
truffles: 
yes
jonts: 
but also dont take 10 minutes to find a win
snakeface: 
You can miss a win by only thinking for a minute
Fircoal: 
I mean
jonts: 
just ... dont take 10 mintes
Fircoal: 
I'd much rather have my opponent take 10 minutes to miss a win
Fircoal: 
than to take 10 minutes and get a win
truffles: 
i'd rather them not take 10 minutes at all
jonts: 
i'd much rathe rplay dominion
truffles: 
5 minutes is fine
snakeface: 
I'd have clicked the button in either case consequences be damned
SamE: 
ok I'm back
jonts: 
ok sam probably wins this turn?
snakeface: 
Sam might not remember how to play Dominion
nerdbound: 
sorry
jonts: 
well nerd duds so we have 2 turns to win now
SamE: 
darn I wanted to play it out
nerdbound: 
haha oh whoops
truffles: 
kanye resign'd
SamE: 
was looking for a Hunting Grounds trash to empty estates :P
jonts: 
continue with bots
nerdbound: 
total dud
SamE: 
oh you had a dud?
SamE: 
that makes sense then
SamE: 
I can report
nerdbound: 
yeah coulda left good cards on top but then i didn't see any hope so i thought i had to high roll
nerdbound: 
probably that was wrong
SamE: 
I don't know that I left you any outs there
nerdbound: 
yeah
nerdbound: 
needed you to totally dud if i couldn't win that turn
nerdbound: 
which i was very close to but couldn't quite pull off
nerdbound: 
anyway
nerdbound: 
fun boards!
SamE: 
yeah
nerdbound: 
good times
SamE: 
interesting ones
nerdbound: 
thanks for playing
SamE: 
you too, good luck in the rest
nerdbound: 
sorry if i overanalyzed everything :-P
nerdbound: 
good luck
SamE: 
heh
nerdbound: 
peace
SamE: 
take care
