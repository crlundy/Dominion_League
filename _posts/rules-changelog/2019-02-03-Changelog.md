Deleted Section VIII. Incomplete Games:

**Quote**
> **VIII. Incomplete Games**
>
> If a game unexpectedly ends because either Dominion Online breaks down or one of the players accidentally disconnects (internet connection lost, computer crashes, ...) please use the following guidelines.
> 1. Discuss the game together with your opponent. Was the game completely open, or was either player ahead? And if there was a lead, was it small, significant or almost insurmountable?
> 2. Based on the players assessment of the game, you may chose one of the following options:
> * If you decide game was even or the lead was small, simply replay the game.
> * If you decide one player had a strong lead, report this game as 0.75-0.25 in favor of the leading player.
> * If you decide one player had a very significant lead, then that player should be awarded a win for that game.
> 3. We know that arbitrating this process with your opponent may be scary. Determining the state of a Dominion match is not a very scientific process especially when the players that have to make these decisions are competing. An ideal result is not possible when disconnects are involved, and there is no expectation of a perfect outcome. The purpose of this process is to give clear guidelines for players to adhere to when resolving the situation. If you really feel like you were ahead, and your opponent feels the same, then you are entitled to some equity and this process attempts to provide that.
> 4. Please know that in coming to an agreement may require one player to lose some equity. E.g. If you estimate there you have a 5% chance to win a game, then resigning it due to a disconnect may not feel great because you have given up a chance you had to win that game. It's still the most fair option, because 5% is a lot closer to nothing than to 25%.  We do not allow match results more precise than 0.75/0.25 because estimating win chances in these situations is very imprecise.
> 5. If you and your opponent cannot come to an agreement about the game state, you can chose to defer the decision to your group moderator. Your moderator won't enjoy making this decision for you, so please make every possible effort to come to an agreement with your opponent. Both players should post their thoughts on the game state in their group's thread and which result they think is best before sending a message to the group moderator. Make only one post with your opinion. There will not be any extended discussion about the game. The group moderator will make a decision based on the players statements and their own evaluation of the game. This decision could be a win/loss, replay, tie, or 0.75/0.25.
