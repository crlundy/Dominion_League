Fixed mistaken wording regarding the way expansions work on Dominion Online:

**Quote From: Old Rules**
> **II. Match Structure**
>
> [...]
>
> The League standard is to play games on Dominion Online with VP tracking enabled with the player who owns the most cards hosting randomly generated kingdoms. These standards should be followed for all games unless both players agree to alternate arrangements. (Games may be played without VP tracking, in person, with modified kingdom selection options, ect., but both players must consent.) If you wish to make arrangements that differ from the league standard, you should make this clear to your opponent when scheduling your match.

> The League standard is to play games on Dominion Online with VP tracking enabled on randomly generated kingdoms using all cards that either player owns (the default on dominion.games, no matter who hosts the table). These standards should be followed for all games unless both players agree to alternate arrangements. Games may be played without VP tracking, in person, with only a limited set of expansions, particular kingdom cards you want practice with, etc., but both players must consent. If you wish to make arrangements that differ from the League standard, you should make this clear to your opponent when scheduling your match.
