**Quote From: New Rules**
> **VII. Respectfulness**
>
> Players are expected to treat one another with respect at all times. Examples of poor conduct include swearing at another player or otherwise harassing them, excessively complaining about luck, rage-quitting and leaving a scheduled match, or intentional slow-playing.
>
> If another player acts abusively towards you, you should contact your moderator as soon as possible. You are encouraged to provide screenshots of game chats or forum/discord messages as evidence.
>
> Depending on the severity of the offense, violating this rule may result in a warning, a ban of one or more seasons, or a permanent ban from the League.

(Numbering of later sections was modified appropriately.)
