> You're not required to own any cards in order to sign up, and who owns what will not have any influence on how players are placed into groups.
> When a player joins for the first time, they are placed in a division based on the availability of spots and their level on the Dominion Online Leaderboard.
> At the end of each season, players must indicate if they intend to stay in the league, or leave for the next season. You will not automatically re-enter the next season without specifying your preference. Please indicate whether you intend to return for the next season or not in your division's scheduling thread before the end of the season.
>
> Available spots that are created when players leave the league will be filled with players in the following order:
> Players who left the league after a prior season within the last year (up to six seasons before the new one) are inserted at the level they previously earned.
> Players who are joining for the first time, or who we were unable to place based on criteria #1 will be inserted into remaining openings by their rating on the Dominion Online leaderboard.
> The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 2nd are promoted.
The player or players who had the best score(s) in their division among those who placed 5th skip demotion.
