volfied caught a part of the rules that was under the old "F is the new E" thinking... there is still demotion and promotion between E and F like any other pair. (We might want to consider creating a beginners G division at some point...)


**Quote From: Old Rules**
> **III. Standings**
>
> During the season, the standings for each group will be automatically updated as players complete matches. The players in each group will be ranked based on the average number of points they have received in each match. Ties are broken in the following order.
>
> 1. Number of total points from matches between the tied players
> 2. The sum of the number of points received in each match multiplied by the total score of the opponent from that match.
> 3. Coin Flip
>
> At the end of the season, players who place 1st in their groups will promote to the next higher division, and players who place 5th and 6th will demote to the next lower division. (e.g. the players who place 5th and 6th in the A group will demote to the B division, and the players who place first in B1 and B2 groups will promote to the A division to take their places.) Players in the F division, are not required to promote to the E division unless they wish to; similarly, Players in the E division will not demote to F unless they wish to. (However, the League may require a player to promote from F or remain in the E group if the player's ability is not in line with the F division.)

For instance, the players who place 5th and 6th in the A group will demote to the B division, and the players who place first in B1 and B2 groups will promote to the A division to take their places. We might possibly be more lenient in the lower divisions depending on overall numbers.
