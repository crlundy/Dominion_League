I finally got around to updating the rules on dropping players mid-season as we voted on last week.


**Quote From: Old Rules**
> **IX. Dropping Players Mid-Season**
>
> Players dropping out during the season have a significant negative impact on their group. Unfortunately, some must drop out, or become inactive and have to be removed by the moderators. It is difficult to deal with matches that have been played by a player who has dropped because the matches they played and failed to play can have a significant impact on the group standings. The following rules are used for dropped players:
>
> * If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer game.
> * If the removed player has played exactly 1 match, the match result is voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer game.
> * If the removed player has played more than 1 match, the results will be retained in the standings unless there are other reasons to void those results (e.g. if there is evidence suggesting that the dropped player purposefully threw games prior to dropping). However, the players who are dropped are then ineligible and finish below all other players, which often means they would demote in any subsequent season in which they might return.
>
> **Players who drop mid-season will be banned from participation in the next 2 League Seasons.** If a player drops out within the first week of the season or is in good standing with the League (i.e. has played in prior seasons without drops or late finishes) the ban period may be reduced or eliminated per the moderating team's discretion.

The following rules are used for dropped players:
> * If the removed player has not played any matches, they are simply removed and the remaining players in the group will play one fewer match. If possible, the moderators will seek to replace them with another player from the waiting list.
> * If the removed player has played fewer than 3 complete matches, any games they played are voided, and the remaining players will play one fewer match.
> * If the removed player has played at least 3 complete matches, the results will be retained in the standings. In addition, so as not to compare any players with different numbers of games played, any unplayed games with dropped players will be simulated by averaging the average winning percentage of the dropped player and the average losing percentage of their opponent in all games they did play. The dropped player is then considered ineligible and finishes below all other players, including possible demotion in any subsequent season in which they might return.
