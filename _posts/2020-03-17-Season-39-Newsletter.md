Hello everyone,

Season 39 will be the first Dominion League season with eight tiers. As I've been explaining to people, the easiest way to think about it is that we've added tiers D/E and E/F, and then renamed all of the tiers to just the letters A through H. In fact, the E and F transition schemes from Season 38 are the exact same as the F and H transition schemes going forward, so it's really as if E and F players were already in F and H, respectively. Here are those transition schemes again:

**Other Changes**
Apart from this big change, we only have a few small changes (see the minutes below for full details):

- This will be the first season with Menagerie! The default rules will be to include the new cards. However, we ask that all playtesters identify themselves to their League opponents and offer their opponents flexibility to play without them if they desire.
- The moderators have more flexibility to address inequities around dropped players with extra "tiebreaker" matches.


**Moderator Churn**
While there is a lot of change going on, it helps to have a steady set of leaders. We will have the exact same moderator crew for the fourth consecutive season!

**Suggestions?**
As a reminder, you can reply to [the forum post](http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=20176.0) with any reasonably-complete suggestions you would like the moderators to discuss at their next rules meeting, tentatively scheduled for the weekend of May 9-10, and we guarantee we will discuss and vote on your suggestion. (You can also still give feedback in the Returning Forms and through Town Halls as usual.)
